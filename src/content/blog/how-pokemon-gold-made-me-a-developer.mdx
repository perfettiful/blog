I was maybe ten years old when I first discovered that software could be exploited.

Not broken in the "my cartridge doesn't work" sense, but manipulated in a way that felt like magic. I'm talking about the infamous clone glitch in Pokemon Gold—and honestly, discovering it changed the entire trajectory of my life and sparked an interest in understanding how systems can be subverted.

## The Setup

Picture this: it's a Saturday morning, I'm sitting cross-legged on the carpet in front of the TV, Game Boy Color in hand. Pokemon Gold had consumed my entire existence for weeks at this point. I'd beaten the Elite Four, caught Lugia, and was deep into the post-game grind of trying to catch them all.

But there was a problem. I had exactly one Master Ball, and there were way too many legendaries left to catch. Trading was complicated because none of my friends had the game yet. I was stuck.

Then my older cousin mentioned something that sounded absolutely insane: "You know you can duplicate your Pokemon and items, right?"

## The Clone Glitch

He showed me how to do it, and I remember feeling like I was doing something forbidden. The process went something like this:

You'd go to a PC in any Pokemon Center, deposit the Pokemon you wanted to clone (holding whatever item you wanted duplicated), and then save the game. Then you'd withdraw the Pokemon from the box. Here's where it got weird: you'd go to switch boxes, and the game would ask if you wanted to save. You'd say yes, and then at a very specific moment during the save process, you'd turn off the Game Boy.

When you turned it back on, the Pokemon would be in your party AND still in the box. Two of the same Pokemon. Whatever item it was holding? Duplicated too. Master Balls for days.

## My First Exploit

Looking back, this was my first real encounter with exploiting a vulnerability in software. Of course I didn't think of it that way at the time—to ten-year-old me, it was basically sorcery. But something clicked in my brain that day.

I started asking questions I'd never thought to ask before. Why did this work? What was happening when the game saved? Why did timing matter so much? If you turned it off too early, nothing happened. Too late, and your save would corrupt (learned that one the hard way).

The glitch exploited a **race condition** in the game's save system. When you changed boxes, the game saved the box data separately from your party data. By interrupting the save at just the right moment, you could end up with the game having saved the Pokemon to the new box but not yet having removed it from your party. The game's state became inconsistent, and that inconsistency worked in your favor.

This is the same class of vulnerability that security researchers find in real systems today—race conditions, timing attacks, state inconsistencies. The fundamentals haven't changed.

## The Rabbit Hole

After that, I became obsessed with understanding how things could be broken. I learned about MissingNo in the original Pokemon games—a corrupted data Pokemon that could multiply items by exploiting buffer overflows. I discovered that Ocarina of Time had entire categories of speedrun techniques based on wrong warps and memory manipulation.

This curiosity eventually extended beyond games. I wanted to know how websites worked, so I started viewing source code and poking at developer tools. I wanted to understand how programs ran, so I started learning about memory, assembly, and how computers actually execute code.

Every system I encountered became a puzzle—not just to use as intended, but to understand deeply enough to find the unintended paths.

## Security Mindset

Now I work in software, and that glitch-hunting mentality has become invaluable. Whether you call it hacking, security research, or just thorough testing—it's all about understanding systems deeply enough to find where they break.

The best security professionals think like attackers. They ask: What assumptions did the developers make? What happens if I violate those assumptions? What states "shouldn't" be possible but somehow are?

Debugging production issues often feels exactly like hunting for glitches. Finding the specific conditions that cause a system to behave unexpectedly. The thrill I get from tracking down a particularly nasty bug feels exactly like the thrill ten-year-old me felt turning off that Game Boy at precisely the right moment.

## Full Circle

I sometimes wonder if Game Freak knows how many security researchers and developers they accidentally created with that one poorly handled save routine. Probably more than a few of us owe our careers to that beautiful, exploitable mess of a feature.

So thanks, Pokemon Gold. Thanks for the infinite Master Balls. But more importantly, thanks for showing me that understanding how systems really work—including how they fail—is the key to everything.
