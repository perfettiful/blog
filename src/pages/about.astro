          Hey there! I'm Nathan, a software developer with a passion for building things that matter.
          My journey into tech started in an unexpected way: through video games. What began as curiosity
          about how games worked turned into a lifelong obsession with understanding and creating software.
        </p>

        <p>
          These days I spend my time exploring new technologies, writing code, and occasionally writing
          about the things I learn along the way. This blog is my space to share those thoughts and
          hopefully help others who are on a similar journey.
        </p>
